# What is simple designing ?

Complexity can really hold you back when developing software. So the simplest solutions are the best when building robust and efficient systems. Simple design is a fundamental principle that can help designers create effective, easy-to-use products. But what does it mean to design simply, and how can we achieve it?

        In 2014 Corey Haines published the book “Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple Design” where he
described about the 4 rules of simple designing .

**The rules **

1. Tests pass
2. Expresses intend
3. No duplication (DRY)
4. Small
