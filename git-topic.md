### Git

[**What is git ?**](https://git-scm.com/)  
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.  

[ **Version control** ](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)   
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that we can recall specific versions latter.  

 *Local Version Control system*   
 Copy files to an another directory is the easyest way to do version controlling, but it can also error prone.  
 To deal with thiss issue, programmersmlong ago developed local VCSs that had a simpple database that kept all the changes happens with the file under version control system.  

 *Centralized Version Control System*  

 The next major issue that people encounter is that, they need to collaborate with developers on other syatem. To deal with this problem *Centralized Verson control (CVCSs)* is interduced.  

The system have a single server that contains
all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many
years, this has been the standard for version control.  
This setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure. If that server goes down, then during this time nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they‚Äôre working on.  

*Distributed Version Control Systems*  
  
This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in.In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial,
Bazaar or Darcs), clients don‚Äôt just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully
mirror the repository, including its full history.  
Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were
collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to
restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  

[**Basic Operation**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary)  

**Git Config :** 
   The [```git config```](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-config#:~:text=The%20git%20config%20command%20is,modify%20a%20configuration%20text%20file.) command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level.   
   *command*  
   user.name- ```$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"```

   user.email- ```$ git config --global user.email "you@yourdomain.example.com"```  

**üëâ Working with new project**

**1.Git init :**  
Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control.  
*command:* ```$ git init```  

**Git status :**  
Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. You‚Äôll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see exactly what‚Äôs being included in the next snapshot.  
*command :* ```$ git status```  

**Git add**  
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

add selected untracked file-  
 ```$ git add file1.txt```  
or  
 ```$ git add file1 file2 file 3``` 

add all untracked file at once-  
```$ git add .```    

[Q. what is the role of . in git add . ?](https://www.designcise.com/web/tutorial/what-does-git-add-dot-do#:~:text=The%20dot%20in%20the%20git,in%20directories%20above%20and%20below)  
The dot in the git add . command is simply a pathspec (which may also be a filepath), that tells git to only look for changed files in the current directory (i.e. it omits paths found in directories above and below).    

**Git commit**  
Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.  
*command :* ```$ git commit -m  "commit message"```  

**Git branch**  
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.

*Common Options:*   
```$ git branch ```:  List all of the branches in your repository. This is synonymous with ```$ git branch --list```.  

```$ git branch <branch-name> ```: Create a new branch called < branch-name >. This does not check out the new branch.  

```$ git branch -d <existing-branch-name> ```: Delete the specified branch. This is a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù operation in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.  

```$ git branch -D <existing-branch-name>``` : Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.

```$ git branch -m <renamed-branch-name>``` : Rename the current branch to < renamed-branch-name>.  

```$ git branch -a```:  List all remote branches.  

*Creating remote branches*  
```$ git remote add <ref-name > <url> ``` :Add remote repo to local repo config.  
```$  git push <ref-name> <branch-name >``` :
 push the < branch-name> to < ref-name >

**üëâ Working with existing project**  

**Clone repo :**   
Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.  
*command :* ```$ git clone <repo-url >```

**Pull from repo :**  
Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch.

*command :* ```$ git pull < remote-name > < branch-name >```   
  
**Fetch from repo :**   
Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project.

*command :* ```$ git fetch ```   

**Git merge**
A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. After forking the project history with git branch, git merge lets you put it back together again.  
*command :* ```$ git merge ```   

**üëâ Push the files to remote repo**  

**Git push :**  
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
